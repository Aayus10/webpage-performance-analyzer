# InsightIQ â€“ Web Performance Analyzer

**InsightIQ** is a sleek and responsive web application that analyzes any public website's performance using key metrics such as:

- Load Time  
- Page Size  
- Total Number of Requests  

Built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **React Query**, **Mantine UI**, and powered by the **Google PageSpeed Insights API**, this tool helps developers and website owners evaluate and improve web performance.

## Features

- Enter any website URL and get real-time performance metrics.
- Clean UI with animations and smooth user experience.
- Responsive design, optimized for all screen sizes.
- Uses React Query for caching and efficient async data handling.
- Accessible components with Mantine.

## API Integration

This project uses the [Google PageSpeed Insights API (v5)](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) to analyze website performance on desktop devices.

> I used **ChatGPT** to learn about how to work with the Google PageSpeed API and how to integrate it effectively within a Next.js frontend architecture. All application logic, design decisions, and UI implementation were done independently.
